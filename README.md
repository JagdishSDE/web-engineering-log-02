# Web Engineering Log – 02

This repository is part of my ongoing **web engineering revision log**.

I have been deeply interested in technology since the late 2000s (around 2009), exploring computers, systems, and software fundamentals over the years. At this stage, I am revisiting **core web development concepts** with an engineering-first mindset, focusing on clarity, structure, and correctness rather than shortcuts or trends.

## What this log covers
- HTML table structures
- Use of `rowspan` and `colspan`
- Timetable-style layouts
- Basic styling for alignment and readability
- Reinforcement of foundational frontend concepts

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is **revision and consolidation of fundamentals** as part of a long-term journey toward professional frontend and full-stack development. Each log builds incrementally, ensuring strong basics before moving to more advanced UI, frameworks, and backend systems.

## Approach
- Focus on fundamentals
- Clean, readable markup
- Incremental improvement
- Engineering discipline over rapid copying

This repository represents **practice with intent**, not experimentation without direction.

Future logs (`web-engineering-log-02`, `03`, …) will continue expanding into deeper frontend concepts and full-stack development.
